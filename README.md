leading to confusion and increased support calls.

## Solution
An LLM-powered assistant that:
- Answers questions based on policy text
- Explains terms clearly
- References relevant policy sections
- Avoids legal advice
- Responds safely when information is missing

## LLM & Approach

- Prompt engineering for clarity and safety
- Context-aware responses using policy content

## Prompt Strategy

- Avoid providing legal advice

## Outcome
This assistant helps users understand insurance policies quickly without reading
entire documents, improving customer experience.
